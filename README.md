# Energy Tracker

This project is a web application built and designed to track and manage energy consumption data in real-time. Users can view consumption trends over time, gaining insights into energy usage patterns.

## Technologies Used
- **Next.js 14** Utilized for server-side rendering, API routes, and seamless page navigation.
- **React 18** Powers the interactive UI components and dynamic data updates.
- **Tailwind CSS** A utility-first framework for fast, responsive design using predefined classes.
- **MongoDB** Serves as the database for storing device and energy usage data.
- **TypeScript**  Ensures robust, type-safe code throughout the app.
